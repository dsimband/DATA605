# Hotels Las Vegas Strip

Abstract: This dataset includes quantitative and categorical features from online reviews from 21 hotels located in Las Vegas Strip, extracted from TripAdvisor ([Web Link]).

Data Set Information: All the 504 reviews were collected between January and August of 2015.

Attribute Information: The dataset contains 504 records and 20 tuned features (as of â€œstatus = includedâ€, from Table 1 of the article mentioned below), 24 per hotel (two per each month, randomly selected), regarding the year of 2015. The CSV contains a header, with the names of the columns corresponding to the features marked as â€œstatus = includedâ€, from Table 1 of the aforementioned article.

df <- read_delim(destfile, delim=';' ,col_names = TRUE, col_types = list('Hotel stars' = col_factor()))

```{r}

```



```{r}

summary(mylm)

```

<b><i>The linear regression model has p-value of less 0.05 so we reject the Null hypothesis in favour of the alternate hypothesis. However the model has a low predictive capability with an Adjusted R-squared of 0.068 </b></i>



```{r}

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(mylm)

```






```{r}

hist(mylm$residuals, main = "Histogram of Residuals", xlab= "", col= "lightblue")

```
<b><i>
	
- Residuals vs Fitted - residuals are uniformly scattered around 0
- Normal Q-Q - we see a stair step that deviates indicated line with obvious non linearity
- Residual Historgram - the residial histogram is not normally distributed and skews right

</b></i>
